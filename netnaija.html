        This book is a hands-on Xamarin.Forms primer and a cross-platform reference for building native Android,
        iOS, and Windows Phone apps using C# and .NET.
        If you think of the Xamarin platform as a pyramid with Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS at its base and
        Xamarin.Forms on top, that’s what this book covers with C#. Mobile UI makes up the lion’s share of the
        pyramid, and this book explores the important concepts, elements, and recipes using Xamarin layouts,
        controls, and lists.
        The burning question in many new Xamarin projects is this: is Xamarin.Forms right for my project?
        This book covers the salient considerations in the comparison of the Xamarin.Forms option vs. a
        platform-specific approach with Xamarin.Android or Xamarin.iOS.
        When you’ve reached the limits of what Xamarin.Forms can do out of the box, you’ll want to customize your
        Xamarin.Forms controls by using custom renderers to leverage platform-specific features.
        You’ll also learn all of the key Xamarin UI navigation patterns: hierarchical and modal, drill-down lists, tabs,
        navigation drawer, and others. You can use the provided navigation code to build out the skeleton of just
        about any business app.
        This book is a guide to SQLite data access. We’ll cover the most common ways to access a SQLite database in
        a Xamarin app and how to build a data access layer (DAL). Once you have a database set up, you’ll want to
        bind your data to your UI. You can do this by hand or use Xamarin.Forms data binding to bind UI elements
        to data sources. We’ll cover many techniques for read and write data binding to both data models and to
        view models for a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture.
        Building an app requires more than a UI and data access; you’ll also need to organize your code into a
        professional-grade architecture. We’ll explore solution-building techniques from starter to enterprise to help
        you decouple your functional layers, manage your platform-specific code, and share your cross-platform
        classes for optimal code reuse, testability, and maintainability.
        Who This Book Is For
        If you’re a developer, architect, or technical manager who can read C# examples to learn about
        cross-platform mobile development using the Xamarin platform, then this book is for you. C# developers
        will probably be most at home with this book because that’s what I am, but I’ve made an effort to point out
        when Microsoft or .NET lingo is in use. The Xamarin platform has a way of bringing technologists from
        different backgrounds together.

        How to Download Code Examples
        All of the code for this book, the C# and Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) solutions, can be
        found in two places online:
        Apress web page for this book, on the Source Code/Downloads tab (www.apress.com/9781484202159)
        GitHub at https://github.com/danhermes/xamarin-book-examples
        XAML
        This book was written in the same way that the Xamarin platform is built, code-first in C#, so all of the book
        examples are in C#. All of the C# UI examples were ported to XAML as well, and made available in the
        downloadable code. Look for the XAML boxes for tips on where to find them.
        XAML The XAML version of this example can be found at the Apress web site (www.apress.com), or on GitHub
        at https://github.com/danhermes/xamarin-book-examples. The Xamarin.Forms solution for this chapter is
        ThisChapterSolution.Xaml.
        The hardest decision I made in writing this book was not including XAML examples in the book proper.
        Including XAML would have meant doing away with much or all of the material on Xamarin.Android and
        Xamarin.iOS, topics that are indispensible for a complete understanding of the Xamarin platform. I chose to
        adhere to my mission for this book: cross-platform C# code-first coverage of the foundations of the Xamarin
        platform. That said, I understand that there is a strong need for good XAML documentation and examples.
        So although I wish that there had been enough time and room to include XAML examples in the text of the
        book, I’m proud to say that we were able to provide downloadable XAML equivalents for all of the C# UI
        examples.
        Get Started with Xamarin.Forms Right Now!
        No time for reading? Browse Chapter 2 for ten minutes, and then download the navigation code for Chapter 6.
        Rip off some of my Chapter 6 navigation patterns to use immediately in your app and get started coding
        right now. Leave the book open to Chapter 3 so you can build some layouts inside your navigation pages.
        Good luck!
        Chapter Contents
        All of the chapters in this book are cross-platform, weighted in favor of Xamarin.Forms. The UI chapters
        (Chapters 3–6) are written with Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android, and Xamarin.iOS elements side by side
        in a mini-index at the beginning of the chapter to facilitate understanding of concepts across platforms, and
        to make it easier to consider custom renderers when you need them. The first part of those UI chapters is
        Xamarin.Forms, the second part is Xamarin.Android, and the third is Xamarin.iOS.
        Chapter 1—Mobile Development Using Xamarin
        An introduction to the Xamarin platform covering all the key topics in this book.

        Chapter 2—Building Mobile User Interfaces (Xamarin.Forms Intro)
        A Xamarin.Forms primer and a comparison of Xamarin.Forms vs. platform-specific approaches, such as
        Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. Covers Xamarin.Forms pages, layouts, and views.
        Chapter 3—UI Design Using Layouts
        Layouts help us organize the positioning and formatting of controls, allowing us to structure and design the
        screens of our mobile app.
        Chapter 4—User Interaction Using Controls (Views)
        Pickers, sliders, switches, and other mobile UI controls facilitate user interaction and data entry that is
        unique to the mobile user interface and differs from the PC/mouse interface, largely because of the use of
        gestures.
        Chapter 5—Making a Scrollable List
        Lists are one of the simplest and most powerful methods of data display and selection in mobile apps.
        Chapter 6—Navigation
        Navigation lets a user traverse an app, move from screen to screen, and access features. Hierarchical, modal,
        navigation drawers, drill-down lists, and other key patterns make up the core of mobile UI navigation. State
        management is the handling of data passed between screens as the user navigates through the app.
        Chapter 7—Data Access with SQLite and Data Binding
        SQLite is the database of choice for many Xamarin developers. Store and retrieve data locally by using
        SQLite.NET or ADO.NET. Using Xamarin.Forms data binding, fuse UI elements to your data models. Use the
        MVVM pattern by binding to a view model.
        Chapter 8—Custom Renderers
        Extend the stock Xamarin.Forms controls and take advantage of platform-specific UI feature sets while
        maintaining a cross-platform approach using custom renderers.
        Chapter 9—Cross-platform Architecture
        Architect your cross-platform application by managing platform-specific code. Project-level options in
        Xamarin include Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) and shared projects. Cross-platform coding techniques
        include conditional compilation, dependency injection (DI), and file linking.
        How to Read This Book
        This book covers quite a breadth of material, and there are a few ways to approach it. Here are the main
        navigation paths built into this book and how to use them. If you are interested in
        • Cross-platform Development: Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android, and Xamarin.iOS
        Read the book from cover to cover. Every word in this book was written for you. After
        you read Chapters 1 and 2, peruse the first few pages of Chapters 3–6 to understand
        the UI material covered in the book.
        • Xamarin.Forms
        Read Chapters 1 and 2, and then read the first third of Chapters 3–6, which covers
        Xamarin.Forms UI. Then read Chapters 7, 8, and 9 for data access, custom renderers,
        and architecture.
        www.it-ebooks.info
        ■ Introduction
        xxxiv
        • Xamarin.Android
        First, make sure you are up to speed on Android basics. See “Prerequisites” later
        in this Introduction. Then read Chapter 1 and the first half of Chapter 2. Read the
        middle section of Chapters 3–6, which covers the Android UI. Then read Chapters 7
        and 9 for data access and architecture.
        • Xamarin.iOS
        First, make sure you are up to speed on iOS basics. See “Prerequisites” later in this
        Introduction. Then read Chapter 1 and the first half of Chapter 2. Read the end
        section of Chapters 3–6, which covers the iOS UI. Then read Chapters 7 and 9 for data
        access and architecture.
        • General Reference
        Read Chapter 1 and the first half of Chapter 2 to get oriented. Then peruse the
        first few pages of Chapters 3–6 to understand the UI material covered in the book
        and how it is organized. Use the beginning of each of these UI chapters as a crossreference.
        So many paths to pick from. This is a choose-your-own-adventure book.
        CODE COMPLETE
        There is a “Cliff’s Notes” navigation path through this book too. If you just want the bottom line on a topic,
        find the section you’re interested in and jump right to the CODE COMPLETE section. This is a complete code
        listing at the end of many (but not all) major topics. Many times all we want is a quick code recipe on a topic,
        and that’s how to get it here in this book. If you need explanation about the code, turn back to the beginning
        of the section and step through the detailed construction of that code.
        What Platform Am I Reading About Now?
        Stay oriented while reading about different platforms by using the platform headings beneath major topic
        headings. Here’s what the headings look like:
        xamarin.forms
        This heading denotes Xamarin.Forms topics.
        android
        This heading denotes Xamarin.Android topics.
        ios
        This heading denotes Xamarin.iOS topics.
        windows phone
        This heading denotes Xamarin.Forms Windows Phone topics.

        cross-platform
        this heading denotes topics that are useful for Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.
        Look for the platform headings beneath the major topic headings and you’ll always know what platform
        you’re reading about.
        Prerequisites
        If you’re mainly using Xamarin.Forms, you should be able to pick up this book without much else in the
        way of background, besides some C#. However, if you want to get serious about using Xamarin.Android,
        Xamarin.iOS, or Xamarin.Forms custom renderers, please note the following:
        This is not an Android 101 primer. Although it provides some introduction to key
        topics and then moves on to “202” material, you’ll need to consult other sources
        for mastery of Android and Xamarin.Android fundamentals. Consult a
        Xamarin.Android primer on topics such as the following:
        • Creating a Xamarin.Android solution using Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio
        • Xamarin Designer for Android
        • Activities, XML layouts, and views
        • The activity life cycle
        • The basic UI controls: TextView, EditText, Button, and ImageView
        • Fragments
        • Images and screen sizes
        • Local resources
        • Gestures
        This book is not an iOS 101 primer. Although it provides some introduction to key
        topics and then moves on to “202” material, you’ll need to consult other sources
        for mastery of iOS and Xamarin.iOS fundamentals. Consult a Xamarin.iOS primer
        on topics such as the following:
        • Creating a Xamarin.iOS solution using Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio
        • Xcode Interface Builder or Xamarin Designer for iOS
        • Storyboards and segues
        • UIView and UIViewController
        • The basic UI controls: UILabel, UITextField, UIButton, and UIImageView
        • Images and screen sizes
        • Local resources
        • Gestures

        What’s Not In This Book
        The Xamarin platform is a monumental project, spanning technologies and APIs of several operating
        systems. Writing about all of it in enough detail to be useful would require not hundreds but thousands
        of pages, which means that not everything could be addressed in one book. There is no coverage of the
        following:
        • Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) for Xamarin.Forms in the book
        proper, but there are complete, downloadable XAML code examples.
        • Integrated development environments (IDEs) including Visual Studio and Xamarin
        Studio.
        • UI Designer tools including Xcode Interface Builder, Xamarin Designer for iOS, and
        Xamarin Designer for Android.
        • Some introductory Xamarin.Android topics (see “Prerequisites”)
        • Some introductory Xamarin.iOS topics (see “Prerequisites”)
        Windows Phone
        Xamarin.Forms apps will run on Windows Phone. Windows Phone projects can be built to support
        Silverlight or WinRT. This book was written for Windows Phone Silverlight implementations, but much of
        what is written here applies to WinRT as well (and some WinRT differences are pointed out).
        System Requirements
        Whether you’re developing on a Mac or Windows workstation, you will need to download and run the
        Xamarin unified installer at http://xamarin.com/download. This will allow you to install and configure the
        Xamarin platform including the Xamarin Android SDK, Xamarin iOS SDK, Xamarin Studio, and Xamarin’s
        plug-in for Visual Studio, as appropriate.
        Here are the OS and software requirements for Xamarin development.
